# Walking Behavior Agent-Based Model

This repository contains an agent-based model (ABM) that simulates walking behavior in a hypothetical city, examining how socioeconomic status (SES), built environment, and social factors influence walking patterns.

This ABM investigates spatial determinants of social inequalities in walking behavior by modeling dynamic interactions between individual attributes and environmental factors. The model incorporates feedback mechanisms and individual-environment interactions to simulate realistic walking patterns across different socioeconomic groups.

## How to Run

To run a basic simulation:

```python

solara run app.py

```
